        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          For my universtiy module, I had to create a portfolio website to present my two briefs (<a href="../blog/bbc-subtitle-icon.html">BBC Subtitle icon</a> &amp; <a href="../rubyside.html">Rubyside Redesign</a>) to the clients. To do this, desk research
          was done looking at other portfolio websites and inspiration to best get my <b>"style"</b> across. Once done, a logo was created, which would help me decide on the colour scheme of the website. The logo was created using low and high-fidelity
          prototypes (yes, again), similarly, the website was designed in the same way. The website was then ran through some cross-browser tests to check its compatibility.
        </p>

      <div class="body-sec">
        <h2>The Reason</h2>
        <p>
          Portfolio websites, a great way to show off your style, passion and previous work. I was required to create a portfolio website to showcase my work done for some <b>"clients"</b>. In the past, I have messed around with making my own portfolio
          site but never had the confidence to make it live. This module was the perfect way to dedicate lots of time into my site, and force myself to make a live site. The portfolio site had to be created, and the briefs had to be presented in a blog
          style format (just like the one you are reading now).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="body-sec">
        <h2>Desk Research</h2>
        <p>
          To start, I looked at how others approach making their own portfolio websites. Luckily, finding other people's portfolio websites was a breeze <b>as so many people have one.</b> Looking at what others did allowed me to understand the best and
          worst ways to display content, as I would look at some websites and wonder "why is that there?" or "why does that look like that?".</p>
      </div>
      <div class="body-sec">
        <h2>Logo Creation</h2>
        <p>
          Once the desk research was complete, I wanted to create a logo prior to starting my website design. To do this, I first created (LOADS OF) low-fidelity prototypes, followed by high-fidelity prototypes of the best ones.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          Low-Fidelity Prototypes
        </h3>
        <p>
          Pages and pages of low-fidelity prototypes were created. I initially approached it from a web designer approach, such as putting my name inside curly brackets as you see lots of web designer portfolio site using a similar logo. Then I thought, actually,
          yeah... <b>you see lots of web design logos like that</b>. So then I tried to think more outside the box, I thought about meaning surrounding my name, then it hit me. My last name is <b>MARS</b>. I always hear people telling me "that
          name sounds like it should be in a movie" or "coolest name ever". Trust me, it gets old after a 20 years.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          With the theme of space in my head, I went off drawing a "JM" with rockets blasting off over it, the letter "J" with a planet (resembline Mars) orbiting it and many more.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-multi">
        <img src="images/portfolio/low0.png" />
        <img src="images/portfolio/low1.png" />
        <img src="images/portfolio/low2.png" />
      </div>
      <div class="body-sec">
        <p>
          This all seemed too complicated, or the ones that seemed too simple were too boring or had no meaning. I wanted a simple logo, that had meaning - is that too much to ask? Then, I created the logo you see today, thats right, the one at the top of the screen.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-multi">
        <img src="images/portfolio/final-logolow.png" />
      </div>
      <div class="body-sec">
        <p>
          It is meant to resemble the Sun, Earth and Mars, all in the correct order of the solar system. There are a few reasons behind this.

          <li>
            My last name is "Mars" (like the planet), I am on Earth (which justifies the middle blue/green planet) and those two planets orbit the sun (in that order).
          </li>
          <li>
            The three dots look like the start of a cartoon though bubble. This could show that I am a thinker.
          </li>
          <li>
            The icon was flipped after the initial low-fidelity prototype, this is to resemble an upwards graph (from left to right).
          </li>
          <br /> So there we have it, I have a logo that was simple and has meaning. Now I had to create it using PhotoShop so that it could be used in my website.
        </p>
        <h3>
          High-Fidelity Prototypes
        </h3>
        <p>
          During the high-fidelity prototyping for the logos, I thought I would mock-up some other logos I created just incase they look better in high-fidelity form.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-multi">
        <img src="images/portfolio/high-fid1.png" />
        <img src="images/portfolio/high-fid2.png" />
      </div>
      <div class="body-sec">
        <p>
          Yeah... they didn't, and I was really happy with the outcome of the final icon. The main website has text with my name accompanying the logo though.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-multi">
        <img src="../img/logo.png" />
      </div>
      <div class="body-sec">
        <h2>Website Creation - Prototyping</h2>
        <p>
          The website could now start to be created to match the colour theme of the logo. Again, many low-fidelity prototypes were created to best understand a good design and layout. Here are a few examples:
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-multi">
        <img src="images/portfolio/low-fid-web1.png" />
        <img src="images/portfolio/low-fid-web2.png" />
      </div>
      <div class="body-sec">
        <p>
          Various low-fidelity prototypes were taken forward and created in a high-fidelity format to help understand the best format further.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="body-sec">
        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>
          With the high-fidlity prototype chosen, the website development could begin. The website has a 1 page layout, containing 4 sections: <b>Home, About, Portfolio and Contact</b>.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Home
        </h3>
        <p>
          The home section is intended to simply welcome the user, state my name and what I do. For this reason, the home section contains only a navigation bar, my logo and name with a subheading saying "Web &amp; UX Design" and lastly, an image of myself (not that I have any good ones). The nav bar has no decoration surrounding it and is the same colour as the "Mars" circle on my logo, which is the colour used across the website for highlights (<b>*psst* like this</b>). It was originally going to be the blue, but the blue on the white background did not meet the WCAG 2.0 requirements. This section works using <b>CSS media queries, flexible boxes and CSS animations</b>. The media queiries change the navigation bar and logo depending on the screen or window width, whilst the flexible boxes position the content of the section. The CSS animations make the content slide into view from different directions.
