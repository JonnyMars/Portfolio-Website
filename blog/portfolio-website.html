          Cleversteam, the people who run Rubyside (<a href="rubyside.co.uk">rubyside.co.uk</a>) provided me with a brief. They wanted the current Rubyside website to be redesigned, making it look more modern and up to date. Firstly, desk research was
          undertaken to understand the styling of "Ruby" and "Ruby on Rails" based websites. Once this was done, a set of requirements for the website were formed. Next, low-fidelity prototypes were created, followed by high-fidelity prototypes. From
          the high-fidelity prototypes, the best prototype was taken and worked on to deliver the final version of the updated website.
