        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          Cleversteam, the people who run Rubyside (<a href="rubyside.co.uk">rubyside.co.uk</a>) provided me with a brief. They wanted the current Rubyside website to be redesigned, making it look more modern and up to date. Firstly, desk research was
          undertaken to understand the styling of "Ruby" and "Ruby on Rails" based websites. Once this was done, a set of requirements for the website were formed. Next, low-fidelity prototypes were created, followed by high-fidelity prototypes. From
          the high-fidelity prototypes, the best prototype was taken and worked on to deliver the final version of the updated website.

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Cleversteam have indicated that they would like thier Rubyside website (<a href="rubyside.co.uk">rubyside.co.uk</a>) to be redesigned. They believe that it is starting to look a bit dated, and that it needs a revamp. The main goal of the website
          is to get users to sign up to Rubyside events, via an EventBrite link. Cleversteam have indicated that they would like their logo and brand colors to stay the same, but would like the new website to share some traits of other "Ruby" based websites.
          The new page only has to be HTML/CSS.
        </p>

        <h2>Desk Research</h2>
        <p>
          Firstly, desk research was completed to gather an understanding of the stying of other "Ruby" based websites, as Cleversteam requested. There were three sites analysed during the desk research, Ruby on Rails (<a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">rubyonrails.org</a>),
          ThoughtBot (<a href="https://thoughtbot.com/">thoughtbot.com</a>) and Heroku (<a href="http://heroku.com/">heroku.com</a>). This desk research helped to understand the layouts used, colour schemes, terminology and more.

        <h2>Low-Fidelity Prototyping</h2>

      <div class="body-sec">
        <p>With loose knowledge of how the websites should be designed, I went about sketching some designs for the websie, some were safe whilst others were quite... uhh... unique. The best three designs were chosen from the low-fidelity prototype and were
          taken forward. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="body-sec">
        <h2>High-Fidelity Prototyping</h2>
      </div>

        <p>
          From the three chosen low-fidelty prototypes, 3 higher-fidelity mock ups were created. From the three chosen, one was an obvious winner. It used the Rubyside brand colours, it had an animated ruby background and had lots of space for new content in the
          future. With the chosen high-fidelity prototype in place, the website development could start.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="body-sec">
        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>
          The development process of the Rubyside update saw some changes from the original prototype. The sections were changed to no longer be center aligned, illustrative (placeholder) images were added in to help keep the user engaged, and new content was written
          to match (instead of just using the text from the original website). The website is made up entirely of <b>flexible boxes</b> which enables the whole website to be responsive, allowing users on mobile devices to see all of the content
          in a nice format. The first thing the user will see is the animated grey-on-grey ruby background, which slowly slides across the screen beneath the Rubyside logo (see in the codepen below). <b>This tells the user that the topic of the website is Ruby/Ruby on Rails.</b>          Each different bit of content had its own, different coloured, section to help the user distinguish where the content was seperated. In the footer, there is a subtle link to the Rubyside Twitter account and Slack channel as per request. These
          are represented by a Twitter icon and a Slack icon.

        <h2>Cross-Browser Testing</h2>
        <p>
          Once the development was finished, the game was tested amongst different browsers. It was found that the website worked well across all browsers, however; on Internet Explorer, there were some <b>slight alignment issues</b>, this does not affect the useage of the website.
