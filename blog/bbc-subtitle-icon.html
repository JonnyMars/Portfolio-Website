        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          The BBC provided me with a brief. They wanted their subtitle icon, which is used across all of their websites, updating to be more recognisable by all audiences. Firstly, icons were researched and competitors' icons were analysed to provide a solid knowledge
          base. From the research, many low-fidelity prototypes were created to gather ideas for the potential new icon. The 4 best low-fidelty designs were then chosen to be mocked up in the form of high-fidelity prototypes. These 4 high-fiedlity prototypes were then
          tested on the public to understand how users would interpret them. Using the results from the tests, the best icon was identified and reccomended.

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          The BBC use a shared media player across an array of websites, such as iPlayer, Sport, News and more. The icon is currently used is the letter "S" inside a white square. The colour scheme changes depending which website is being visited, the icon also adapts and also changes colour scheme.
          The icon currently has four different states: off, hover off, on and hover on.

        <p>
          The initial issue that can be seen when looking at this icon is that it is inaccessible for an international audience. The BBC iPlayer website has four different language options, English, Welsh (Cymraeg), Gaelic and Scottish Gaelic. In Welsh, "subtitles" translates to "isdeitlau". Similarly,
          in Scottish Gaelic "subtitles" translates to "fo-theideal". Straight away, people visiting the website who speak these languages may not be able to understand the meaning of the "S" icon. This isn't even taking into account other international users, from loactions such as France, Portugal etc.

        <h2>Literature Review</h2>
        <p>
          Once the problem was understood, a literature review was undertaken to understand what makes a good icon. The main findings from the literature review are as follows:
        </p>
          <li>Icons provide a concise summary and quicker understanding of information in comparison to plan text.</li>
          <li>Good icons should be easily recognisable, visually appealing, compact and easy to use on a touch screen device.</li>
          <li>The colours used wihin an icon have a massive impact on the user, highly contrasting colours make the icon stand out.</li>
          <li>Users prefer icons with a negative image polarity (light characters on a dark background).</li>
