        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          The BBC provided me with a brief. They wanted their subtitle icon, which is used across all of their websites, updating to be more recognisable by all audiences. Firstly, icons were researched and competitors' icons were analysed to provide a solid knowledge
          base. From the research, many low-fidelity prototypes were created to gather ideas for the potential new icon. The 4 best low-fidelty designs were then chosen to be mocked up in the form of high-fidelity prototypes. These 4 high-fiedlity prototypes
          were then tested on the public to understand how users would interpret them. Using the results from the tests, the best icon was identified and recommended.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="body-sec">
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          The BBC use a shared media player across an array of websites, such as iPlayer, Sport, News and more. The icon is currently used is the letter "S" inside a white square. The colour scheme changes depending which website is being visited, the icon also
          adapts and also changes colour scheme. The icon currently has four different states: off, hover off, on and hover on.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/bbc-subtitle/bbc-init-states.png" />
      </div>
      <div class="body-sec">
        <p>
          The initial issue that can be seen when looking at this icon is that it is inaccessible for an international audience. The BBC iPlayer website has four different language options, English, Welsh (Cymraeg), Gaelic and Scottish Gaelic. In Welsh, "subtitles"
          translates to "isdeitlau". Similarly, in Scottish Gaelic "subtitles" translates to "fo-theideal". Straight away, people visiting the website who speak these languages may not be able to understand the meaning of the "S" icon. This isn't even
          taking into account other international users, from loactions such as France, Portugal etc.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="body-sec">
        <h2>Literature Review</h2>
        <p>
          Once the problem was understood, a literature review was undertaken to understand what makes a good icon. The main findings from the literature review are as follows:
        </p>
        <li>Icons provide a concise summary and quicker understanding of information in comparison to plan text.</li>
        <li>Good icons should be easily recognisable, visually appealing, compact and easy to use on a touch screen device.</li>
        <li>The colours used wihin an icon have a massive impact on the user, highly contrasting colours make the icon stand out.</li>
        <li>Users prefer icons with a negative image polarity (light characters on a dark background).</li>
      </div>
      <div class="body-sec">
        <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Using the knowledge gained from the literature review, the subtitle icons used by various BBC competitors were analysed to see what was being done well and what was being done badly. According to the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (2018), BBC,
          ITV, Channel 4, Sky and Channel 5 were the top viewed channel groups in the UK during January. These were all analysed (apart from Sky), along with other well known video streaming services such as YouTube, Amazon Prime and Netflix.
        </p>
        <h3>Channel 4</h3>
        <p>
          Channel 4's "All 4" web player has a subtitle icon very similar to the BBC's. It has the same four states as the BBC, however; it has two more states that appear when the user hovers over the icon for an extended amount of time. Doing this triggers a
          small tool-tip which says "Subtitles ON/OFF". This icon is also an "S", just like the BBC's icon, which causes issues for international users.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/bbc-subtitle/c4states.png" />
      </div>
      <div class="body-sec">
        <h3>ITV</h3>
        <p>
          ITV have exactly the same states as Channel 4's "All 4" subtitle icon. However, the long hover over the icon is slightly more advanced as it detects if the subtitles are on or off and changes the tool-tip text to match.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/bbc-subtitle/itvstates.png" />
      </div>
      <div class="body-sec">
        <h3>Channel 5</h3>
        <p>
          Channel 5 again have a similar icon, which is an "S" in an off-white circle. When hovered above, the icon turns white which is quite difficult to notice. Once clicked, the icon remains white to signal that subtitle have been turned on. Turning it off
          is the same process.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/bbc-subtitle/c5states.png" />
      </div>
      <div class="body-sec">
        <h3>Netflix</h3>
        <p>
          Nextlix has the most complex icon seen thus far. The icon resembles a square speech bubble with mutliple horizontal lines within it to represent text. It is initially grey and once hovered over, it turns a slightly lighter shade of grey.
          This icon really comes to life when clicked, as a sub-menu appears letting the user change the audio language and choose the subtitle language (if available). By having no text in the icon (such as "S"), it means that the icon is universally understandable.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/bbc-subtitle/netflixstates.png" />
      </div>
      <div class="body-sec">
        <h3>Amazon Prime Video</h3>
        <p>
          Amazon Prime video steps up the complexity yet again. The icon is similar to Netflix's icon. When hovering over the icon, some text appears below the icon saying "Subtitles and Audio". Once clicked, a sub-menu appears similar to Netflix.
          One difference is that Amazon's subitles show the different languages in their native languates. For example, instead of saying "French" it would say "Fran√ßais". This is just another layer of accessibility for international users.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/bbc-subtitle/amazonstates.png" />
      </div>
      <div class="body-sec">
        <h3>YouTube</h3>
        <p>
          The YouTube subtitle icon's features are similar to Amazon's. The icon is a rounded rectangle with mutliple horizontal lines inside, similar to Netflix and Amazon's icon, just without the small triangle that makes it a speech bubble. The icon itself has 4 states, however; once clicked, a sub-menu appears letting the user choose their desired language (if available). Like Amazon, the list of languages are displayed in the native languages.
        </p>

        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>
          There was a clear pattern between all of the UK based services, and similarly, there was a pattern between all of the more global services. The UK services all have an "S" as their logo, and do not seem to give any option within the icon to change the language of the subtitles.
          All of the global servies (Netflix, Amazon, YouTube) had very similar icons displaying no text, and all three services had a pop-up allowing the user to choose their desired language.
        </p>

        <h2>Low Fidelity Prototyping</h2>
        <p>
          With an understanding of competitor icons and knowledge of what makes a good icon, the design process started. Initially many sketches were created to try to create as many potential icons as possible. The best 4 low-fidelity prototypes were outlined and would be taken further.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Low-Fidelity Prototype 1
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/bbc-subtitle/lowfid1.jpeg" />
      </div>
      <div class="body-sec">
        <p>
          Icon 1 has 3 lines to represent text filling up the whole icon. The lines representing text are transparent so that when hovering over the icon, the colour corresponding with the directory shows up around and behind the icon. When subtitles are turned on the new icon functions the same way as the current icon does, a line matching the directory colour appears underneath the icon.
        </p>
      </div>
    <div class="body-sec">
      <h3>
        Low-Fidelity Prototype 2
      </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="image">
      <img src="images/bbc-subtitle/low-fid2.jpeg" />
    </div>
    <div class="body-sec">
      <p>
        Icon 2 follows a similar format as the Amazon and Netflix icon by having a speech bubble with 2 transparent lines at the bottom of the icon to represent text.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="body-sec">
      <h3>
        Low-Fidelity Prototype 3
      </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="image">
      <img src="images/bbc-subtitle/lowfid3.jpeg" />
    </div>
    <div class="body-sec">
      <p>
        Icon 3 combines the design of icon option 1 and 2 together, as it removes the idea of being a speech bubble but only contains two lines to represent text at the bottom of the icon. The corners have also been rounded due to the K &amp; L guide stating that rounded corners give icons softer edges, the result looks similar to YouTube's subtitle icon.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="body-sec">
      <h3>
        Low-Fidelity Prototype 4
      </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="image">
      <img src="images/bbc-subtitle/lowfid4.jpeg" />
    </div>
    <div class="body-sec">
      <p>
        Lastly, Icon 4 resembles a more traditional rounded speech bubble. It uses the idea of two horizontal lines at the bottom of the icon that was first seen in icon option 2. The four finalised icon options created during the low fidelity prototype section will be evolved by creating high fidelity prototypes for each icon.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="body-sec">
      <h2>
        High Fidelity Prototypes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Once these 4 were identified as the best icons, they were created using Adobe PhotoShop to resemble what they would look like in use.
      </p>

    <h2>
      Testing
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next step is to test the icons on users, to see how users react to the icon in a real world setting. Prototypes of the icon on the BBC media player were created using InVison, which allows the user to interact with the icon. Before testing, the user was required to read a participant information sheet and sign a consent form so that the results can be discussed in this research. Once that was complete, the participant would be shown each prototype in a separate web browser tab and view each icon in every possible state (subtitles off, hover and off). Lastly, the participants were given a question sheet which contained 3 simple questions, which icon they prefered (quantitative), which icon they disliked the most (quantitative) and asked for any additional feedback (qualitative).
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="body-sec">
      <h3>
        Most Preferred Icon
      </h3>
      <p>
        From the results of the test, the user's voted Icon 2 as the most preffered icon with a majority vote of 60% followed by Icon 1 and Icon 4 getting 20% of the votes each.
      </p>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/bbc-subtitle/liked.png" />
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="body-sec">
      <h3>
        Most Disliked Icon
      </h3>
      <p>
        Looking now towards the second question asking which icon the user's liked the least, Icon 1 was disliked the most after collecting the majority of the votes (60%) followed closely by Icon 4 having 40% of the votes. Icon 2 and Icon 3 did not gain a single dislike vote, knowing that Icon 2 was the most liked icon these results indicate that Icon 3 was also liked a fair amount in comparison to Icon 1 and 4.
      </p>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/bbc-subtitle/disliked.png" />
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="body-sec">
      <h3>
        User Feedback
      </h3>
      <p>
        Finally, the participant was given an optional qualitative question asking for any feedback on any of the icons, this could be positive or negative. 3 of the participants left feedback. Firstly, one participant praised the positioning of the two lines on Icon 2 as it "visually represents the subtitles". This comment was helpful as it indicates that the average user is also interpreting it as on screen test which was the intention. Secondly, one user stated that they were unsure that underlining the icons with the matching colour correctly conveyed to the user that subtitles had been turned on. As this method was already the method used on the current media player, also used by YouTube, it felt unnecessary to change it as no other participants reported this problem. Lastly, one user pointed out that Icon 4 looked too much like a "message icon". This was an issue identified when creating the prototypes but was left in to see participants response when interacting with the icon. It has become apparent by 40% of negative votes that this icon is not very popular.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="body-sec">
      <h2>
        Final Recommendation
      </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="image">
      <img src="images/bbc-subtitle/icon2.png" />
    </div>
    <div class="body-sec">
      <p>
        The results from the tests made the final icon an obvious decision. Icon 2 is the final recommendation for the new BBC media player subtitle icon. The icon is universal, testing made it clear that the icon is visually appealing and lastly it is easily recognisable. As it is fairly similar to Amazon and Netflix's subtitle icon, users that also use the BBC media player will have no trouble recognising Icon 2.
Icon 2 works well as it is, although if it required any changes to make it more compliant with the K &amp; L guide, the corners could be rounded like they are in Icon 3. Judging by the current subtitle icon, it does not seem that the K &amp; L guide is required as much as it used to be, the K &amp; L guide may be outdated as it was last updated in February 2013.
